# Summary
The goal of this lab was to familiarize students with the equipment we will be commonly using throughout the lab. Another purpose for this lab was to educate us on the limitations of the tools that we will be working with. This was done by comparing ideal and actual measurements along with the comparison of measurements taken for the same thing for several devices. The outcome of this lab was that we were able to see the shortcomings of the tools we will be working with for the rest of the semester. I also feel "warmed up" to the materials we will be using in lab.

# Test Equipment
 - Function generator
 - Oscope
 - DMM
 - Power source
 - Various resistors and capacitors

# Test Procedures
**Part 1** - Comparison of ideal vs. actual resistance using DMM
1. Determine and record the ideal resistance of the resistors given
2. Using the ideal resistance find the tolerance
3. Measure and record the actual resistance 
4. Check to see if actual resistances fall within the found tolerance
5. Repeat for each resistor

**Part 2** - Comparison of ideal vs. actual capacitance using DMM
1. Determine and record the ideal capacitance of the capacitors given
2. Using the ideal capacitance find the tolerance
3. Measure and record the actual capacitance 
4. Check to see if actual capacitances fall within the found tolerance
5. Repeat for each capacitor

**Part 3** - Comparison of power source ideal voltage vs. actual voltage
1. Set power source to required voltage(s)
2. Measure, record and compare ideal output voltage and actual output voltage
3. Repeat for each required voltage

**Part 4** - Comparing measured amplitude and frequency through different methods
1. Set the function generator to its maximum amplitude and a frequency of 2kHz
2. Connect the Oscope and adjust the parameters to observe the produced voltage
3. Using the Oscope, first measure the sine wave by counting the squares on the screen and using the metric they are measuring
4. Again using the Oscope, use the cursor function to measure period and amplitude
5. Again using the Oscope, utilize the measurement function to find period and amplitude
6. Finally, switch to the DMM and measure the voltage, as well as the frequency
7. Compare results from each measurement method

# Test Results
**Part 1**
|Resistor|Expected Resistance|Actual Resistance|Within Tolerance?|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1|20000Ω|1977Ω|yes|
|2|10000Ω|995Ω|yes|
|3|22Ω|21.9Ω|yes|
|4|3300000Ω|3378000Ω|yes|

# Discussion
**Discussion Question 1** - Did the power source and measured voltage agree?

The instruments do not agree with each other, they display different voltage measurements. The measurements taken from the outputs that only put out 3.3V, 5V, and 	12V experience a larger ideal vs. actual voltage difference. The difference in ideal voltage compared to 	actual voltage may be because of unmeasured internal resistance or errors within the 	power supply. 

**Discussion Question 2** - Do the methods for measuring amplitude and frequency agree?

The DMM measurement differs from the other methods, as the DMM measures true RMS (root mean squared) which equals the peak voltage divided by the square root of 2 while the other methods measure only the peak voltage.  

Reducing the amplitude of the function generator causes the measured voltage to be reduced. Decreasing the number of hertz that the function generator is outputting causes the period of the output wave to increase. The Oscope and DMM respond. Each of the devices has its limit that will eventually be reached.

# Conclusion
In this lab, I relearned how to use common tools in lab. The other main takeway from this lab for me was the limitations of the tools that we are working with. This will be important throughout the duration of the semester to ensure accuracy of data taken.
